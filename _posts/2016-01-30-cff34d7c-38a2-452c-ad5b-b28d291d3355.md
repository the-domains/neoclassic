Why can't The Grid let you login and post from the site you create? The new post button should be one click away.  Each post should be able to have it's own theme and then extend to more posts as needed/wanted. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/026b720c-7f05-4c16-bfa2-6a7389aa827e.png)

Analyze this....
