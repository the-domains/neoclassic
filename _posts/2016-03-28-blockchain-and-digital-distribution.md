Interacting with the music doesn't require Blockchain, but creating a more dynamic and user-rich experience for each piece of music has not been on everyone's agenda since we were able to pick-up vinyl records at the music store and ask the store-clerk to sample the recording. Are you the kind of person who used to browse record shops or libraries looking for something to pop-out and grab your attention. Skimming the movies via NetFlix, AppleTV, or Xfinity based on general interests is where most of us have drifted to for media selection.  We are still confining ourselves to the mobile device where music is in the background as the soundtrack for the other things we could be doing without music. 

What about good old fashioned music exploration?

Imogene Heap is trying to push the envelope with music expression (the glove thing...) and with digital rights management (the blockchain thing...).  

Note the interesting jump links for "Stems", "Lyrics", and "Inspiration".  This is the new way of facilitating that your music is not "one of a kind" but able to be used in a "transformative" journey to the next creative work. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/f97954e1-0c2b-43c0-87d5-e8c839bbce08.png)
